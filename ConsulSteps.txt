To work with Consul: 
	
1) STart up Consul (using "consul agent -dev" ), by default in port 8500
2) Add our Consul depedency into our Spring Boot project
	"spring-cloud-starter-consul-discovery"
3) Add an annotation "EnableDiscoveryClient" onto our Driver class 
4) Add spring.application.name="something" to our project application.yml file 
5) Add in Spring Boot actuator depedency, so that consul can do health checkups.
