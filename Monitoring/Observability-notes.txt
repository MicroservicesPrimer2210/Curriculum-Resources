Observability:
	Ability to assess the internal state of a system by measuring extarnal
	observations. 

	Monitoring vs Obseravability?
	Monitoring is watching the state of a system, using metrics, traces or
	logs. Observability is built on top of monitoring.

	In practice, to achieve observability, we build our applications so that
	they can expose their internal states. 

Distributed Tracing: 
	In a monolithic application, this is unnecessary. Our error/exception 
	stack trace will tell us the sequence of method invokation. 

	With MSA, services will likely communicate with multiple other services 
	which makes it difficult to track a single request.

	With DT, it is a method of observing requests as the propogate through the
	distributed cloud environment. The request is given a unique identifier so 
	that it can be tracked while it spans multiple services. 

	Zipkin and Sleuth 

	Zipkin: Open source tool built by Twitter to manage the collection and 
		lookup of data. To use Zipkin, apps are instructed to report
		timing data to it. 

	Sleuth: Used to generate trace id, span id and add this information to 
		the service calls. This is used with Zipkin to be able to read
		the data we're generating. 
	

	Working with Zipkin and Sleuth: 

	1) Stand alone Zipkin server 
		a) Download and run the jar file 
		b) use a docker image: 
			docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin

	2) Adding Zipkin and Sleuth depedencies to our Spring project 


Micrometer: 

	Depedency that we can add to our Spring project to expose metrics at an endpoint. 
	With micrometer, we can use the prebuilt metrics and also add our own metrics on top. 
	Different kinds of metrics, like gauages, counters

	1) Add depedencies: 
	   
	   <dependency>
	      <groupId>io.micrometer</groupId>
	      <artifactId>micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
	      <scope>runtime</scope>
	   </dependency>

	   <dependency>
	      <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
	      <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
	      <version>2.7.4</version>
	   </dependency>

	2) application.properties: (expose the prometheus endpoint)

	management.endpoints.web.exposure.includes=*

Spring Cloud Config 
	Allows us to remotely host our configuration details in one location, to allow us to add/update 
	configuration details for all our services. 

	1) We need to create a location with our configuration details!

	2) Set up a Spring project as our config server, that communicates with out remote repository and 
		sends that information to our client services. 

	  pom.xml: 
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-config-server</artifactId>
		</dependency>

	  java: @EnableConfigServer

	  application.properties: 
		spring.cloud.config.server.git.uri=<git repo location> 

	3) Setting up the rest of our projects to be cloud config clients, accept the configuration details from 
		our server. 

	   pom.xml:
		<dependency>
		    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
		    <artifactId>spring-cloud-config-client</artifactId>
		    <version>3.1.3</version>
		</dependency>

	   application.properties: 
		spring.application.name=<matching the properties file> 
		spring.config.import= optional:configserver:http://<endpoint>:<port>
