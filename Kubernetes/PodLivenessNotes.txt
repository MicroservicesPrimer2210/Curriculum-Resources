Pod probes: 

	Liveness probes: 
		Checks when to restart a container. It's meant to catch crashes or stalls, e.g. deadlock.
		(When an app is running, but unable to make progress)

	Readiness probes:
		Checking when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.
		If a Pod is not ready, it is removed from the Service Load Balancer. 

	Startup probes
		It disables liveness and readiness checks until it succeeds. Just to make sure that the
		readiness and liveness probes don't interfere with the startup. This will make sure that
		kubelet will not kill it before it has a chance to finish its start up.
