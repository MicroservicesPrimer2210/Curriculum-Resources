What is Helm?
	Helm is a package manager for K8. Allows us to define, install and upgrade complex K8 applications. 

	Helm uses charts - a chart is a collection of files that describes the related set of K8 resrouces. 
	For example a single chart might be used to deploy a pod or an dentire web app, with deployments, services 
	, volumes, etc .

What is a chart?
	An organized collection of files inside of a directory. The directory name is the name of the chart. 

	e.g. a directory will contain: 
	Chart.yaml: a YAML file containing information about the chart 
	values.yaml: default configuration values for this chart 
	crds/: custom resource definitions  
	chars/: A directory containing any charts upon which this chart depends on. 

Kubernetes Cluster ingress: 

An API object that manages external access to ther service in a cluster, typically via HTTP. 

Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting. 

Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing 
	is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource. 

client -> load balancer (managed by ingress) -> ingress - routing rules -> services -> pods


Prerequsites: You must have an ingress controller. An ingress resource by itself is pretty useless.
